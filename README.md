Hello ! 

### What is this?

This repository consists of shortnotes,summarys and practice questions that I gathered during my self studying journey.

#### How can you use this?

You can checkout my notes and summaries, most of them are written on **Jupyter Notebooks**! and I highly encourage you to follow *my steps* and cater it to your own pace.

To make sure that I have understood every single thing that I have learned. I am going to explain them simply as possible in my [blog]() and in my youtube channel.
