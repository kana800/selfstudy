#### TEST YOURSELF :hourglass:

1. A universal statement asserts that a certain property is **true** for **all elements in a set**
2. A conditional statement asserts that if one thing is **true** then some other thing **has to be true**
3. Given a property that may or may not be true, an existential statement asserts that **at least one thing** for which property is true.

#### Exercise set 1.1 :heavy_plus_sign:

> In each of `1-6`, fill in the blanks (marked in **bold text**) using variables to rewrite the given statement 

1. Is there a real number whose square is `-1 `?

   - Is there a real number `x`  such that **square of x  is equal to ** `-1`

   - Does there exist **a real number x** such that `x^{2} = -1`

2. Is there an integer that has a remainder of `2` when it is divided by `5` and a remainder of `3` when it is divided by `6`?

   - Is there an integer *n* such that *n* has **remainder of** `2` **divided by** `5` and **remainder of** `3` when divided by 6
   - Does there exist **an integer** *n* such that if *n* is divided by `5` the remainder is `2` and if  *n* is divided by `6` remainder is `3`
   
3. Given any two distinct real numbers, there is a real number in between them.
   
   - Given any two distinct real numbers *a* and *b*, there is a real number *c* such that *c* is **a real number in between a and b**
   - For any two **real number *a* and *b***, **real number *c*** such that *c* is between *a* and *b*

4. Given any real number, there is a real number that is greater.
   
   - Given any real number *r*, there is a **real number** *s* such that *s* is **greater than r**
   - For any **real number *r***, **there is a real number *s*** such that `s > r`.
   
5. The reciprocal of any positive real number is positive.
   
   - Given any positive real number *r*, the reciprocal of ***r* is positive**.
   - For any real number *r*, if *r* is **positive**, then **reciprocal of *r* is positive**.
   - If a real number *r* is **positive**, then **reciprocal is positive**.
   
6. The cube root of any negative real number is negative.
   
   - Given any negative real number *s*, the cube root of ***s* is negative**
   - For any real number *s*, if *s* is **negative**, then **cube root of *s* is negative**
   - If a real number *s* **is negative** , then **cube root of *s* is negative**

7. > Rewrite the following statements less formally, without using variables. Determine, as best as you can, whether the statements are true or false.

   - >  There are real numbers *u* and *v* with property that `u + v < u - v`

     Given any two distinct real number, when the two real numbers are added it is greater than when two real numbers are subtracted.

     Above statement is **TRUE**, `u = -1 ` and `v = -2` then `u + v = -3` and `u - v = 1` therefore `u + v < u - v`.

   - > There is a real number *x* such that `x^{2} <  x`.

     Given any real number, the square of real number is smaller the real number.

     Above statement is **FALSE**, if `x is negative `, `(-1)^{2} = 1` ,`-1 ` **is not greater than** `1` and if `x is positive`, `(2)^{2} = 4`, `4` **is not greater than** `1`.
     
   - > For every positive integer *n*, `n^{2} >= n`.
   
     Given any positive integer, the square of the integer is greater than or equal the integer.
   
      Above statement is **TRUE**.
   
   - > For all real numbers *a* and *b*, `mod( a + b) <= mod(a) + mod(b)`.
   
     Given two distinct real number, the modulus of the sum of two number is less than the sum of the individual modulus of both numbers.
